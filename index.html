            <h2>Emergence of Scaling in Random Networks</h2>
            <span>A.-L. Barabási, R. Albert / Science 286, 509-512 (1999)</span>
            <p>Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex
                topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free
                power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i)
                networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach
                preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients
                reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of
                large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the
                individual systems.</p>

            <h2>Statistical mechanics of complex networks</h2>
            <span>A.-L. Barabási, R. Albert / Reviews of Modern Physics 74, 47-97 (2002)</span>
            <p>Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society. Frequently cited examples
                include the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network of
                routers and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems have been modeled
                as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks are
                governed by robust organizing principles. This article reviews the recent advances in the field of
                complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After
                reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the
                main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the
                emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network’s robustness
                against failures and attacks.</p>
